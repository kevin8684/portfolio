        <p class="textspacing aboutmedesc">Hi, my name is Kevin Voth. I spend most of my time behind a computer, whether that being coding, working, or gaming. I took a couple classes over the years, two of them being networking and web application. I took networking last year, and I am currently in web application this year. Last year I learned subnetting, cabling, and computer building, and this year I am learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and SQL. CART is an amazing opportunity to get hands experience on the thing I love, coding.
