                    <p class="projectsdesc textspacing">This was my third website project I worked on this year. This was an interesting project for me, and it was definitely a learning experience for me. My whole class came together and came up with a color scheme and format. My story board and color scheme was eventually picked and was used on the website. Each group worked on separate sub pages, and my team worked on the issues and scams page. <br>The website is about spreading awareness about  the risks involved with the internet. We also gave ways for people to protect themselves from potential consequences that can come from online activity </p>

                    <p class="projectsdesc textspacing">This was my second big project of the year. This was also a group project, but it wasn't as big of a group as the digital ethics projects. Me and my partner used Github to work together on this simple website. This website was aimed on spread awareness about an almost endangered animal (in my case I chose the Bengal Tiger). I gave reason on why they were going endangered, and gave visitors a way to support the prevention of them going extinct. </p>
